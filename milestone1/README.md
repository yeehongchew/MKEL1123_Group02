# Milestone 1 - STM32 Familiarization 
**Objective:** To familiarize with STM32F4 series microcontrollers through Blinky program.
This milestone is an introduction to STM32F4 series microcontrollers, namely the NUCLEO-F410RB Development Board, demonstrated by the blinking of its LED at 1Hz through a Blinky program in STM32CubeIDE.

## Blinky Program
The _Blinky Program_ in STM32F4 using STM32CubeIDE is a "hello world" program in STM32 Embedded World, as well as an indication that the STM32CubeIDE based development toolchain is active and ready to use.
